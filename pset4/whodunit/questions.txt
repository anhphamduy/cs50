1.  "stdint.h" is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library to allow programmers to write
more protable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact width-integer types, together with the maximum and minimum
allowable values for each type.
2.  Since data types in C do not have fixed-size, or in other words, they can change regards to the different computer architecture,
so we have to use uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t for more unique.
3.  BYTE: 1 byte
    LONG: 4 bytes
    DWORD:4 bytes
    WORD: 2 bytes
4.  ASCII: BM
    HEX: 42 4D
    Decimal: 16973
5.  bfSize = biSize + 54s.
6.  The origin will be reversed.
7.  biBitCount
8.  Because if the file does not exist, and then fopen will return NULL.
9.  It will be number of elements and in this case, it is size of the bitmap file header.
10. 3
11.It sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stram. The new position, measure in bytes, is obtained by adding
offset bytes to the position specified by whence.
12. It is the current position of the file pointer.
